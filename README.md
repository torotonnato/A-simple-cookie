The life and death of a cookie in its journey through a typical

# Chord progression

Eb (I) - Bb (V) - Gb (III) - Db (VII) - Ab (IV)

All those chords are major, key of Eb.

Gb and Db are non-diatonic, but are from parallel keys.
In this first version both chords come from the parallel Eb minor 
key, as reflected by the vocal melodic line ("baked with love and
care").

Other interesting alternatives for those chords:

Gb -> parallel dorian or phrygian
Db -> parallel myxolydian

# Intro

The intro repeats the two non diatonic chords of the main progression.

# General rules

* The basic chord progression must remain intact, you may experiment
with alterations, dynamics, rhythm, without altering the basic
quality of the chords.

* The other sections of the song may have different chord progressions.

* Let's try to emphasize the psychological aspect of the cookie inner
life through music XD

# About that cookie

The chord progression is very uplifting, reflecting the character
vitality and good nature (of course, it's a cookie), but there is
something very dark lurking in the inner depths of its soul:
it wants to be eaten. Why?

This may be a good experiment to practice tension and release.
