TT: Write a rock song about the life of a cookie being
eaten for breakfast. First person point of view.

ChatGPT:

Verse 1:
I'm just a simple cookie
Baked with love and care
But every morning, I'm eaten
Without a second thought or prayer

Chorus:
I'm the life of a cookie
Being eaten for breakfast
My crumbs scattered on the plate
As I disappear in a bite

Verse 2:
Dipped in milk or smothered in cream
I'm the perfect start to the day
But my life is short and sweet
As I'm quickly devoured and thrown away

Chorus:
I'm the life of a cookie
Being eaten for breakfast
My crumbs scattered on the plate
As I disappear in a bite

Bridge:
But I don't mind, I'm just a cookie
Bringing joy with every bite
I may be gone in just a moment
But my deliciousness will last all day and night

Chorus:
I'm the life of a cookie
Being eaten for breakfast
My crumbs scattered on the plate
As I disappear in a bite

Outro:
So here's to the life of a cookie
Being eaten for breakfast each day
We may be small and short-lived
But we bring happiness in every way.





TT: Write a weird chord progression with 5 chords.

ChatGPT:

Here is an example of a weird chord progression using five chords:

Eb - Bb - Gb - Db - Ab

This progression uses chords from the key of Eb, which is not a
commonly used key in popular music. The chords are also all major
chords, which can create a dissonant and strange sound. Additionally,
the progression uses chords that are a tritone apart, which can create
tension and dissonance in the music. This progression could be used in
a experimental or avant-garde piece, and could create a unique and
unpredictable sound.
